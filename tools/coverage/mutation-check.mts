#!/usr/bin/env node
// Proves that tests can fail.
//
// A passing test says nothing about whether it could ever fail. A mutant does:
// change the code to be wrong in one specific way and see the test go red.
// This applies each mutant in a spec, runs that mutant's test, and puts the
// file back whatever happens.
//
//   node tools/coverage/mutation-check.mts <spec.json> [--timeout <seconds>]
//
// The spec is a JSON array. Paths and commands are read from the folder this
// is run in (the project root):
//
//   [
//     {
//       "name": "a price above the previous one moved up, not down",
//       "file": "packages/domain/src/useCases/trackMovement.ts",
//       "find": "mid > before",
//       "replace": "mid < before",
//       "test": "pnpm --filter @skills-demo/domain exec vitest run trackMovement"
//     }
//   ]
//
// `find` is literal text and must occur exactly once in the file. Each row of
// the table is one of:
//
//   KILLED    the test went red with the mutant in place — it can fail
//   SURVIVED  the test stayed green — it cannot see this mistake. That is a
//             finding about the test: strengthen it, or write down why this
//             behaviour is left unchecked
//   NO TESTS  the test command ran no test before any mutant was applied, or
//             left no count of the tests it ran. Nothing was mutated
//   ERROR     the mutant could not be judged, and the reason is given
//
// Exit 0: every mutant was killed. Exit 1: one survived. Exit 2: the spec
// could not be read, or a mutant could not be judged (NO TESTS, ERROR).
//
// A command that runs no test is green, so every mutant behind it would read
// SURVIVED, or KILLED with a runner that fails on no match. Each command is
// therefore run once on the unchanged files, and must be green with at least
// one test passed or failed. Skipped tests do not count.
//
// The count comes from a report file, never from what the runner prints:
//
//   - A command that names `vitest` gets `--reporter=json --outputFile=…`
//     added at its end. So vitest must be the last program in the command.
//   - Any other runner writes the file itself. Its path is in the environment
//     as MUTATION_CHECK_REPORT, and the file is JSON with `numPassedTests`
//     and `numFailedTests` (jest: `--json --outputFile="$MUTATION_CHECK_REPORT"`).
//     A command that mentions MUTATION_CHECK_REPORT is run as written.
//   - A command that cannot count (a script that exits 0 or 1) says so in its
//     row, with the reason: `"uncounted": "a script, not a test runner"`. It
//     is then judged on its exit code alone, as before.
//
// The usual way to run nothing: a `-t` filter that no title matches. vitest
// cuts an `it.each` title at 40 characters, so a filter copied from a longer
// title in the source matches nothing. Filter on the first words.
//
// A spec is code, not data: its `test` commands run in a shell. Do not run a
// spec you have not read.
