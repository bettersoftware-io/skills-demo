# Working in this project

A TypeScript monorepo built on ports and adapters, with a streaming UI on RxJS.
The rules below are enforced by checks, not by convention.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # the React client on the in-browser simulator (no server)
pnpm dev:fs       # the server and the client together
pnpm gate:fast    # architecture gates, lint, typecheck
pnpm gate:full    # gate:fast, then tests and the build (what CI runs)
pnpm test
```

Run `pnpm gate:fast` before you say work is finished. A red gate means the
work is not finished.

## The layers

Dependencies point inward only. `architecture.config.mts` is the declaration
the gates read; a package that is not listed there fails.

| Package | Role | Holds | May import |
|---|---|---|---|
| `packages/domain` | domain | Entities, use cases, port interfaces, simulators | nothing (runtime: `rxjs` only) |
| `packages/shared` | shared | The wire protocol | domain |
| `packages/client-core` | core | Adapters, presenters, state machines, the composition of the app | domain, shared |
| `packages/react-bindings` | bindings | The view model: the only place RxJS meets React | core, domain |
| `packages/client-react` | client | `src/app` (composition root) and `src/ui` (dumb components) | bindings, core, domain |
| `packages/server` | server | The WebSocket server | domain, shared |

## Where a thing goes

- **It needs the outside world** (network, storage, clock): declare a port in
  `packages/domain/src/ports`, in domain words. Write a contract test beside it
  in `__contracts__`. Implement it as a simulator in the domain and as a real
  adapter in `client-core/src/adapters`, and run the contract against both.
- **It is application behaviour** (what data exists, what happens on an intent,
  anything on a timer): a presenter or a state machine in `client-core`.
- **It turns the wire format into domain terms**: the adapter. Nothing past an
  adapter sees a wire message.
- **It reads configuration or picks an adapter**: the composition root,
  `client-react/src/app`. Nowhere else.
- **It is drawn on screen**: a component in `client-react/src/ui`, reading from
  the view model. No RxJS, storage, `fetch`, environment or timers there.

The price list is a worked example of every one of these. Copy its shape:

| Pattern | File |
|---|---|
| Port | `packages/domain/src/ports/pricePort.ts` |
| Contract test | `packages/domain/src/ports/__contracts__/PricePortContract.ts` |
| Simulator | `packages/domain/src/simulators/priceSimulator.ts` |
| Use case | `packages/domain/src/useCases/trackMovement.ts` |
| Real adapter | `packages/client-core/src/adapters/wsPrice.ts` |
| Presenter (shared state, timers) | `packages/client-core/src/presenters/pricesPresenter.ts` |
| State machine (per-component state) | `packages/client-core/src/machines/selectionMachine.ts` |
| View model | `packages/react-bindings/src/createViewModel.ts` |
| Composition root | `packages/client-react/src/app/startApp.tsx` |
| Dumb component | `packages/client-react/src/ui/PriceList.tsx` |
| Page object and its test | `packages/client-react/src/ui/PriceList.page.tsx`, `PriceList.test.tsx` |

## Tests

- Anything on a timer is tested on fake timers, advanced by the exact interval.
  A test never sleeps.
- A UI test talks to a page object. Only the page object touches the testing
  library.
- A fixture factory is named `create…`.
- Tests come first in a test file; helpers go below them.

## TypeScript only

No JavaScript source files. Scripts and tool configs are `.mts`, which Node runs
directly. A file a tool can only load as JavaScript is listed in
`architecture.config.mts` under `javascriptAllowed`, with the reason.

## Reviewing a change

A review in this project does two things first, whoever or whatever does it:

1. Runs `pnpm gate:fast` and shows its output. Not run is not passed.
2. Answers the seven questions in `tools/arch/docs/review.md`, each with its
   evidence as `file:line` and a verdict, including the ones that pass.

Anything else a review finds (robustness, security, performance) comes after
those, never in place of them.

## When a gate fails

Its message says what is wrong and where the code belongs. Fix the code. If you
believe a finding is wrong, or it is outside what you were asked to do, say so;
do not work around the gate or edit the rules to make it pass.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
